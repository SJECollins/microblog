# Micro Blog


Micro project to practice Django, AllAuth, PostgreSQL, some Cloudinary thrown in there for good measure (though whitenoise worked excellently the last time and is actually grand for this too)


**AIM**: User authentification, tying usernames to posts

Deployed to [TempMicroBlog](https://tempmicroblog.herokuapp.com/)
